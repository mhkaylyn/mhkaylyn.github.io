		<h2 style="position:absolute; z-index:3;text-align:left;"> Kaylyn Hyemin Mok</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; position:absolute; z-index: 3; margin-top:80px;">I am a Korean-American gal from Los Angeles, specifically from Glendale, a suburb where there are lots of mountains. I am grateful to have my home in a peaceful neighborhood within a bustling hub that is Los Angeles. Growing up, I was fortunate enough to have had a well-rounded education with a creative upbringing. I learned to draw and paint in a liberal art studio from age 6-15. Though a large portion of my life was spent learning non-digital art, I became passionate about digital graphic art, photography, and design in high school. <br><br> Coming into college, I spent two years indulging in studies that I thought at the time would make profitable and stable careers. However, I soon found that my creative side was too influential in my life to ignore. I changed my interest from computer science to creative development. Currently, I am pursuing advertising at Boston University. <br><br> 2019 was truly a year of introspective thinking. In late 2019, I made the big decision to pursue advertising and work freelance in graphic design and photography. Though I picked up photography in 2012 with the gift of my first DSLR, it was not until 2019 that I became serious about photography and started freelancing. I gradually became interested in portrait and editorial photography. My favorite thing about taking portraits is the interaction between me and the subject; it is such a raw and creative space where we bounce ideas back and forth and think outside the box. Every photoshoot is a learning experience that I enrich in.<br><br> With these experiences and passions, my dream is to become a user/ brand experience designer and freelance photographer. My hope is to meet with and gain inspiration from a myriad of people.</p>
